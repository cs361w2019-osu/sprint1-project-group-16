The game starts up beginning at: /sprint1-project-group-16/src/main/java/views/ApplicationController/index.ftl.html

This html file creates two html tables and assigns them css id's of "player" and "opponent". These id's are used by the javascript in, /sprint1-project-group-16/src/main/java/assets/game.js.
The js here is initialized by the initGame() function at the bottom of the page. This function is called by index.ftl.html in a script tag.

All css is conatined in /sprint1-project-group-16/src/main/java/assets/css/custom.css

Between these three files we should be able to get the game to look however we want.
